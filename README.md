A sample [SSE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) client for iOS in Swift, i.e. iOS version for JavaScript's [EventSource](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventSource) in plainspeak. <br><br>It connects to a SSE URL hosted on local and exposed through `http://localhost:8080/events`. There is a companion project in this GH account that provides a simple server side counterpart for it developed using [Vapor](https://www.swift.org/getting-started/vapor-web-server/). The received events are printed in console, and has support for automatic reconnection in case of an error.<br><br>Note - Apple doesn't provide a built-in support for SSE in its URL connection classes just yet (~2025).
